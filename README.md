# Dotnet Microservices Shop
This project represents a proof of concept for building a fullstack e-commerce application based around microservices architecture with a diverse and rich techstack for example Asp.Net Web API, Docker, RabbitMQ, MassTransit, Grpc, Ocelot API Gateway, MongoDB, Redis, PostgreSQL, SqlServer, Dapper, Entity Framework Core.
